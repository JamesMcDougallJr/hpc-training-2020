# SDSC HPC User Training:  Spring 2020
## WEEK 4: 01/31/2020

## TOPIC:  GPU accelerated computing with CUDA Python	
**Presented By:**  Abe Stern, NVIDIA

### Related Reading and Presentations

[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) supports CUDA GPU programming by directly 
compiling a subset of Python code into CUDA kernels and device functions 
following the CUDA execution model.  

## WEEK 4 TASKS

### TASK 1

In the provided notebooks, a problem is introduced and mostly implemented in 
Numba.  As an exercise, complete the missing lines of code to successfully 
compute the result.
