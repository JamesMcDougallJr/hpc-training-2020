# SDSC HPC User Training:  Spring 2020
## WEEK 4: 01/31/2020

## TOPICS:
This week we will have two GPU related presentations:  
### Topic #1:  Using the NVIDIA Rapids Toolkit on Comet
**Presented by:**  Marty Kandes

**Description**
RAPIDS is NVIDIA's new Python-based framework for accelerating end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines on their GPUs. In this webinar, we'll provide an overview of this new framework and how you can incorporate it in your own research.

In this webinar we will show how to use RAPIDS to accelerate your data science applications utilizing libraries like cuDF (GPU-enabled  Pandas-like dataframes) and cuML (GPU-accelerated machine learning algorithms). We will demonstrate how to use Jupyter Notebooks on Comet to accelerate Data Science workflows with RAPIDS using interactive computing methods. In particular, if you use pandas and/or scikit-learn extensively, you'll definitely want to attend this webinar.

### Topic #2:  GPU accelerated computing with CUDA Python
**Presented by: Abe Stern, NVIDIA**

URL: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-students/hpc-training-2020/tree/master/week4/rapids

**Description**
We will introduce Numba and RAPIDS for GPU programming in Python.  Numba allows us to write just-in-time compiled CUDA code in Python, giving us easy access to the power of GPUs from a powerful high-level language.  RAPIDS is a suite of tools with a Python interface for machine learning and dataframe operations. Together, Numba and RAPIDS represent a potent set of tools for rapid prototyping, development, and analysis for scientific computing.  We will cover the basics of each library and go over simple examples to get users started. Finally, we will briefly highlight several other relevant libraries for GPU programming.
This webinar will use the Zoom conferencing system. You should receive an email with connection details a few days prior to the event. Please send any questions to training-info@sdsc.edu.
